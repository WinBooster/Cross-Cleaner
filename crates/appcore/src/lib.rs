//! Frontend-agnostic application logic for Cross Cleaner.
//!
//! Everything here is state and behaviour only, with no widget toolkit and no
//! windowing system: the category/program selection model, the cleaning job,
//! the configuration file, the updater protocol and the UI sounds. The
//! frontends (`gui` on egui/eframe and `tui` on ratatui) build their widgets on
//! top of [`AppState`] instead of re-implementing the selection rules, so the
//! two frontends can never drift apart.
//!
//! Sounds belong here for the same reason the selection model does: both
//! frontends play the same five clips for the same events, and a check in the
//! window app must sound exactly like a check in the terminal one.
//!
//! What stays in a frontend is presentation: widgets, textures, notifications,
//! window chrome and the key/mouse bindings.
