//! Command line surface: the flags, and the selection they describe.
//!
//! Selection is the interesting part and is modelled on what the terminal app
//! can express, because a command line has no popup to open: a category, a
//! subcategory of one, a whole program, or one program narrowed down to some of
//! its categories. The four levels mirror the terminal's two pages — the
//! category grid with its subcategory overlay, and the program page with its
//! per-program category overlay.
//!
//! Names are matched case-insensitively, because nobody types `Cache` reliably
//! on a keyboard with a caps lock on.
