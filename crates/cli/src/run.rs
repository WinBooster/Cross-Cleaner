//! Running a selection and reporting what came of it.
//!
//! The job itself is [`appcore::cleaning::work`] — this module only drives
//! [`AppState`], exactly the way `tui` and `gui` do: start the run, drain the
//! progress channel, poll for the result. Everything a run reports is already
//! computed by `appcore`; the work here is turning it into lines.
//!
//! Two things the window frontends do not need and this one does:
//!
//! * **Confirmation.** A window app has a button, and clicking it is the
//!   consent. A command line may be run from a script, so `--yes` exists and
//!   the prompt is skipped when stdin is not a terminal: a pipe cannot answer a
//!   question, and blocking on a read that will never come is worse than
//!   refusing to start.
//! * **Interrupt.** Ctrl-C has to stop the run and say what was already gone,
//!   rather than leaving the process killed mid-delete with no report at all.
